Second Commit:

Corrected the bug in Applicant nav link by commenting the dropdown logic. 
Seems BasicReports do not work now. Leaving it as is.

Add a nickname property in user model. This is the unique name that will be shown when user comments.
It allows us to separate real name from the virtual identity.
Nickname gets generated automatically. Ability to change this will be added in later commits.

Made role property an enum

Reverted signup form to the angular (from forms angular) one with additional help message.

fixed few deprecation warnings
